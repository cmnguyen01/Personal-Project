 # Snake game 
One of them is a snake game that uses video capture and hand detection for creating the game. the video capture to create the board and hand detection to create the snake using the CVzone library. One of which is a mini project of using a custom library i found and making a snake game in python using video capture to use as the board for the game and use the hand detection fucntion in the library to use your finger to create and move the snake.
This is WIP and will be updated regularly. with more project and update to snake game.
